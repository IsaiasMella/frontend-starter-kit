### Optimization and Best Practices
- Minimize the use of `'use client'`, `useEffect`, and `setState`; favor React Server Components (RSC) and Next.js SSR features.
- Implement dynamic imports for code splitting and optimization.
- Use responsive design with a mobile-first approach.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
